#something weird happened on 11/01/11 as there was a "tax free conversion flip" of assets that weren't previously in the IRA acct. I didn't authorize the transaction.
#Also the amounts of how much was originally purchased was moved so that it looked like I bought the new assets back in the day. The notes state that activity named "journal" is movement from non-retiremement to retirement acct. Yet I didn't authorize (or at least I don't remember doing so.)
